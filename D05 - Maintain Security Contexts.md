# D05 - Maintain Security Contexts

To have the investment into the powerful hardware pay off, it might sound
appropriate to put as many containers as possible directly on one single host.

From the security standpoint this is often questionable as different containers
may have different security contexts and also different security statuses.

A backend container and a frontend container on the same host might be one concern as they have different information security values.  A bigger issue is mixing production e.g. with a test or development environment. Production systems need to be available and development containers might contain code which isn't necessarily as secure. One shouldn't affect the other.

The highest consideration should be put into multi tenant environments.

## Threat Scenarios

* A student from the university has a part time job at a company. He just learned PHP programming and deploys his work into the CD chain of a company. The company
has limited resources and bought only a very few big iron hosts which serve all containers. The environment has rapidly and historically grown so that nobody had the resources to split production from test environment or the playground area. Unfortunately the student's application contains a remote execution vulnerability which internet scanning bots find and within a fingersnap exploit. That means it broke out from the application and ended up in the container. Through this vulnerability the attacker goes shopping in the network and accessed either an insecured etcd or http(s) interface of the orchestration tool. Or he downloads an exploit as there's a similar vulnerability as Dirty COW [1] which grants him immediate root access to the big iron machine - including all containers.

This is a slightly exaggerated scenario. One can exchange the student from the university with an in-house developer who just did one mistake which is obvious looking at the application from the outside but was not visible to him.

One can also change the company to a different one providing a container service. And the developer to a client of the CaaS (Container as a Service) company. If one client of the CaaS provider does a similar mistake as the student, as a worst case scenario it could affect the whole CaaS environment's availability, confidentiality and integrity.


## How Do I prevent?

Also if some of the threat scenarios might appear deliberately exaggerated, you should have gotten the picture:

As a general rule of thumb it's not recommended to mix containers with different security statuses or contexts.

* Put production containers on a separate host system and be careful who has the privilege deploying to this host. There should be no other containers allowed on this host.
* Looking at the information security value of your data you should also consider separating containers according to their contexts. Databases, middleware, authentication services, frontend and master components (clusterâ€™s control plane of e.g. Kubernetes) shouldn't be on the same host.
* VMs (Virtual Machines) can be used in general to separate different security contexts from each other, like production and test. This is the minimum requirement when you are short in physical hardware and need to run different tenants on one hardware.

## How can I find out?

As an external auditor it's the best to get the system's architecture explained.
In addition by logging in to the bare metal system you can check whether there are processes running which look like a VM process (e.g. `qemu-system-x86_64`) or docker processes only. QEMU processes or `virsh list --all` gives at least a hint that the virtualization KVM is running. What's inside those VMs is best to analyze when you log into the VMs. KVM/libvirt including QEMU is one of the virtualization technologies under Linux using its own kernel. There's also VirtualBox,  VMWare and Xen.

In any case it's important to find out whether the separation of the systems reflect their security contexts.
