## Contributions / participation

is always welcome!

Note please the following:

* One PR per feature or bug fix or improvement. Please do not mix issues.
* Document your PR in the commit message
* To lower the bar: For a few points being not yet complete we have dev branches like D06_dev, D07_dev. If your input is important but not complete or needs more or less polishing or amendments before being merged to main those branches are the ones you should issue use your PRs against.
* If your PR is a WIP, please mark it accordingly. Remove that when you think you're done.

## Document Structure

For an amendment or if you want to fill in blanks for one of the ten points please follow the document structure:

  * Introduction
  * Examples of threat scenarios
  * Recommendation how to prevent the aforementioned threats
  * Technical hints how to identify whether you might have a problem here
  * References (split in commercial and non-commercial ones)

Try to be as non-specific with respect to orchestration frameworks or any other product (OS, programming language).


For questions just open an issue.
